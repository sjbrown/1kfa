Can you read from front to back?  Is there a linear order of reading?

Character creation - earlier?
 * sidebar "Looking for character creation?"
 * for most *players* it's the first time they get to interact with rules
   * looking for the first moment of interaction
   * looking for the first *activity*
   * vector of my imagination into the game -that's my character

Joseph Campell stuff should go earlier

 - Sidebars!
 - Reference manual
 - Linear instruction
 - Linear "read out loud"

 - Give "just enough" detail
 - "Analog hyperlinks" is doable, but it is an "interruption"

If the Player's Guide is just reference, and player's *aren't* going
to read it, can a bunch of it be *moved* to the GM's guide?  I don't
know how many players are actually going to read it "this is the
player's job", etc.

"You and your friends, engaging intently... etc"  rather than
"sitting around a table".
 * "artform"
   versus
 * "product in a market that needs an audience"


Tone: a big part of the Editor's job.
 * there was no way that Sage and I could do that.  We were too close
 * Have someone else do that work
 * Or, put that game away for a *long* time
 * Adam can recommend people


Steven Spielberg & Sam Raimi reference - could be done instead with
a "bibliography section" - here are some books, here are some movies,
etc.  This gives thematic context.

"Say stuff" gives whiplash.  Casual, but in the wrong way. People are
afraid of being the encyclopedia or almanac of the rules.  "Job" is 
a hard word.  "All" is a hard word.  "Domain" is a hard word.  Not
conversational.

The rules are in the books if you need to look them up.

Authority and the ambiguity of decision making.  AW says "it's a
conversation, you know how to have a conversation".

"Sometimes the *game* gets to decide" and that's it - it has it's own
voice, it's at the table too.

Write somethingabout how to *generally* get through a disagreement or
situation of ambiguity.


"I didn't get about the game until I got to the campaign section
the Hero's Journey stuff."  It wasn't until the *end* that that
got exposed.  There's a lot of places in here where it's sort of
"timid".  "This is optional" should become "Tell a story *like this*"

"On the threshold of making something that people will embrace
or not"

Journey Points, etc.

These are the systems created for the *express purpose* for giving you
the experience of the hero's journey.


If I turn the box over, and see the cards, etc.  I would also want to
see in the bullet points, "how is this about the hero's journey and
what mechanisms are you going to give me?"


Highlight it - how the mechanisms hook in.


"Why do I have to spend points to have the bad guys show up, of course
the bad guys show up, that's the whole game!"

Character creation : these are characters that haven't yet gone on
their journey


Look at the rewards.




* Mini-games

 - can it be tied to the stats of the character? - integrated
 - are they sound designs on their own
 - test the shit out of them
   - would you make a character based around lock picking or fundamental magic


* "Extra" rules



It's ok to say "Early in the development of this game, 30-hour
was thought to be the prefered way to play, however during playtest.."


Yes and.. is good for improv- it kills dead air, eg.  But for an
opinionated kind of game, that's not best.  "Yes and.." is a tool to
use at certain times, but this is a game with rules, bounded-authority, etc
 * Archapaeligo is a game that does interesting things with authority

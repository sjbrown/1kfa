# GM Guide - Campaigns

In A Thousand Faces of Adventure, there are 3 different kinds of Campaigns:

 * One-shot (usually 3 hours)
 * 9-hour
 * 30-hour

The stories you will tell by playing 1kFA are told in 3 parts:
beginning, middle, and end.

If you've played other RPGs that *don't have endings*, ones that go on for
months or even years, this might seem weird to you.
Don't worry, try out a 9-hour campaign and see the results.
You may find your doubts erased.

1kFA is designed to tell a particular kind of story.
It's called *The Hero's Journey*.

*The Hero's Journey* is a skeleton upon which many successful and popular
movies and books are arranged: Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Breakfast
Club, Die Hard, Beowulf, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the list goes on.
To help you execute a successful and popular *campaign*, 1kFA
gives the GM *Journey points* and *Shadow points* and specific rules for
using them.

The main premise of *The Hero's Journey* is, characters start out in
a figurative "ordinary world", they go to a "mysterious world", and finally,
they return.

As you and the other players create the narrative, you will have opportunities
to shape events. You decide how the world and the NPCs react to the actions of
the PCs, and you have the freedom to describe the "meanwhile" -- all the
goings-on "off-screen".
Use these powers to pull the narrative into a multi-chapter structure,
and in each chapter, try to earn *Journey points*.

The players may just be along for the ride, or they may also want to delve
into *The Hero's Journey*. Be on the lookout for how they signal that they're
into this kind of fun, and use what they express about themes, relationships,
emotional tone, conflicts, and backstory to co-create the journey.

# It's ok to skip it

You don't need to get every available *Journey point*. You should especially
not try to force it if doing so would sacrifice fun for the players. Remember,
you're not the only author of this story, and while earning points feels nice,
you've got other jobs too, like paying attention to the signals the players
give you about the kind of fun they want to have.

# It's ok to end it

You may find that you and the players have collectively gone as far as you
can. Maybe you've reached the deepest, darkest part of the adventure, and
the characters decide to stay and call it their new home. Maybe they find
a way to destroy something you thought would be permanent, or make permanent
something you thought would be temporary, and that changes the whole conflict
structure of the story. Maybe they found a shortcut or outsmarted the Oracle.

Maybe they all died.

Take a break and ponder. Sometimes you can think of a way to reinterpret
events or move forward with themes while abandoning specifics. Sometimes
you can take a subplot and move it to the forefront.

But sometimes the choice that provides the most fun for everyone is to
just admit that it's over.

Getting *Journey points* is great, but the reason everyone is here
sitting around the table is to *have fun*.

# It's ok to blend it

The boundaries between chapters do not need to be strict, explicitly defined
lines. There may be a natural blending between two adjacent chapters as you
and the players set forth the narrative.

For example, It's common for the 9-hour Campaign to blend chapters 5 and 6.
Maybe the treasure of the dungeon is glimpsed, then the ordeal begins, then
the ordeal gets really serious, and that's the point to really plumb down to
the "dark night of the soul", fully reveal the treasure, and then emerge
to complete the ordeal.

Even when there is a threshold, as in chapters 3 and 7, the different players'
characters might cross over at different times.

# The lengths vary

The final chapter might go very fast, or it might be a long journey home.
The first threshold might be crossed so fast that you only notice after the
fact.
Taking the prize might involve a twisting road of trials, or it might be
one explosive boss battle.

Let the story be what it must be, and *play* to find out the details of what
happens, but also take your opportunities to earn *Journey points* when they
arise.


# One-Shot Campaign

 * Start in a place of normalcy / comfort
 * Cross a threshold with a true choice
 * Take a thing and pay its (mortal?) price
 * Return to the surface, changed.

In a One-Shot campaign, there are 4 potential *Journey points* to earn.

<a name="one-shot-ch-1" />
## Chapter 1: Start in a place of normalcy / comfort

The first *Journey point* is a "gimmie": If you can think of a way to start all
of the PCs in their place of normalcy or comfort, gain a *Journey point*. You
*did* remember to do Step 10 in the Character Creation chapter, right?

Give the players a chance to establish what "normal" is for their characters.
This is an environment that they can manage. They know what to expect here,
and to survive here requires no fundamental change on their part.

Here, the players can get a feel for taking actions and having some dialogue
in-character.
Perhaps they have some interactions with NPCs familiar to them.
Perhaps they describe their character moving through the environment and
pointing out specific details.
Perhaps the characters get into conflict: social, or physical.

As you are playing this out, you should be looking out for two things:

 1. Opportunities to establish a *need* that will move the story to Chapter 2
    * signs of an approaching threat
    * what about their home annoys, frustrates, or stifles them?
 2. A premise. Listen for a statement or action that asserts a fundamental truth
    * "Nobody bakes a pie like Herbert"
    * "Shelbyville thinks they're so great, but really, they stink"
    * "I'm just a Hobbit, I can't steal from a dragon"
    * "Things will go on like this forever"
    * "As long as there's a tree to climb, I don't have to worry about wolves"
    * "If only you could see things from my perspective"

You should make a note of any premise, so you can use it later when creating
puzzles, monsters and villains.


<a name="one-shot-ch-2" />
## Chapter 2: Cross a threshold with a true choice

As the game progresses, the conversation at the table will start
establishing details about the world and about relationships between
characters. Find areas of tension and try to develop that tension.
Push characters into discomfort. Raise the stakes. Then look for a
*threshold*. Look for some line that, once crossed, they can't simply turn
around and go back.
They might enthusiastically seek it out, they might even cross over before
you've figured out what it should be (if so, all that's left for you is
to mark yourself a *Journey point*). But you might also need to increase the
pressures in their "home" to gently nudge the characters up against
that threshold.

But, if you want that *Journey point*, **don't push them through.**

See if the players choose to step their characters through the threshold.
If all of them cross the threshold and step away from their ordinary world
into a mysterious world of danger and adventure, gain a *Journey point*.

### Hooks

A common way to get players to choose to go through the threshold is to create
a "hook". Here are some things to think about to help you invent a hook:

 * Capture, Obstruct, Prevent
    - What is "loose" and causing trouble?
    - What is in the wrong hands or needs to be brought back into the fold?
 * Chase or Race
    - Who else has already begun seeking out the prize?
    - How long until a threat arrives here?
    - How might the hunter become the hunted?
 * Rescue or Regain
    - Who or what was taken, and where does it rightfully belong?
    - What power does the precious thing posses?
 * Re-order, Rearrange, Fortify
    - What is unbalanced, and what effect does that have on the world?
    - Who is not doing their job?
    - What special protection needs to be put around The Hearth?
 * Forbidden Act
    - What is the rule that must not be broken?
    - Who forbids it?
    - What power structure does the rule support?


<a name="one-shot-ch-3" />
## Chapter 3: Take a thing and pay its (mortal?) price

Give the players an opportunity to earn something *epic* for their characters.
It can be a great treasure, it can be fame and renown, it can be weaponry, a
magical boon, the elusive respect of an NPC, it can even be self confidence.
It can be an appreciation for the power of friendship. (Pixar and Disney have
some *incredibly* well-done Hero's Journey stories.)

It's important not to create a prize that just seems cool to you, the GM.
The prize should follow from the fiction. It should be something that is
actually wanted or needed by the players' characters. Pay attention to them,
they are the protagonists in an odyssey. What would be miraculous for them to
receive?

Maybe you don't have to *create* the prize at all. What have the players
been talking about, is there already a specific goal? What themes have already
emerged through the action, dialogue, and relationships?

Put that prize in a terribly difficult location.

It could be at the end of a road of trials, or inside the cave where they
must conquer their greatest fear, or in the clutches of their most powerful
adversary.

### Allot Shadow Points

Whatever the fictional set-up, when you're ready, set up a challenge in
the narrative, then draw a circle around **all** of the *Shadow points*
and use them all before the characters get a chance to Rest.

If you can do this, when they complete the challenge that used up the last of
the set-aside *Shadow points*, give them the prize of this mysterious world
and gain a *Journey point* for yourself.

### Death Is Real Here

This is the chapter of the game where characters are most at risk to lose all
of their Stamina points. In other chapters of the story, the GM may choose to
narrate this as unconsciousness, imprisonment, or something else that
the character will naturally recover from.

But not in this chapter.

If the character loses all their Stamina in this chapter of the story, the GM
should represent this as "death". Sell it as a permanent removal of the
character, and by extension, the player from being able to impact the events
of the story.

Don't make this a downer for the player though. Make the death epic.
Give the character a final stand that saves the day, or gives the other party
members a chance to survive an enormous threat. A moment of tremendous,
meaningful sacrifice. Look for what the character symbolized, or what niche
they filled in the party's personality, and amplify that symbol or personality
aspect to be everyone's salvation.

Also realize you can give them a second chance at life. If you don't want a
gritty, hardcore vibe in your campaign, you don't have to let the death stand.
For rules on ressurection, see [Using Journey Points](#using-journey-points).

### The Prize

The "prize" can be something completely related to the narrative, or it can
invoke the mechanisms of the game, or both.

In giving the characters the prize, you may "break the rules" by removing
a cost or condition. 

So, for example, you may declare that the characters do not have to be
"in a town" to execute the Study Under a Master move. Or the Tales of a
Weapon move may be skipped to award the characters with a powerful weapon.

This relaxation of the rules only applies to Chapter 3, and should be
narratively justified.


<a name="one-shot-ch-4" />
## Chapter 4: Return to the surface, changed.

In the final chapter, find a way to return the characters "home". It need not
be their literal home, nor does it need to be where the adventure started,
geographically. The important thing is: at this stage in the narrative
The Hearth is available again.

You are free to "re-imagine" The Hearth here. If it was previously the song
of the Wood Elves, it can now be the song of the Iron Gnomes. If you keep
the emotional core the same, you can change superficial details. But give
the players enough superficial hints to recognize it.

The heroes are "home", but they are changed. They have been on an adventure,
seen things, done things. They are now masters of a new way of existing,
unafraid of crossing into the previously "alien" world.

By dialogue or action, each player character should exhibit their change.

This can play out in many ways:

 * by using their newfound power to deal with the bullies that previously
   tormented them
 * though they dutifully swore to their holy order to keep this quest secret,
   when they travel back through the badlands, they share the seeds of the
   foreverfruit with the impoverished village that showed them hospitality
 * by not screwing up for once in the eyes of their family, and delivering
   the elves' ointment to cure their grandfather of Medusa's curse
 * by re-igniting the war as they were bade, like a good soldier, but then
   returning to challenge their clan-lord for leadership
 * by being cast out of yet another city, but this time they're on the road
   with mirth in their step and a horse pulling sixteen barrels of mead

Gain your final *Journey point* if you can hit this note.



# 9-hour Campaign

The 9-hour Campaign is a bit more complicated. Committing these 8 points
to memory will make it go a little easier:

 1. You
 1. Need
 1. Go
 1. Search
 1. Find
 1. Take & Pay
 1. Return
 1. Change

(this compact formulation is inspired by Dan Harmon's "Story Circle")

<a name="9-hour-ch-1" />
## Chapter 1: You

**AKA: Start in a place of normalcy / comfort**

In the 9-hour campaign, start the game just like you would in the One-shot
campaign. See [Chapter 1 of the One-Shot Campaign](#one-shot-ch-1)


<a name="9-hour-ch-2" />
## Chapter 2: Need

**AKA: Call to adventure**

In this chapter, the characters still feel safe, but discover that there
is something they need to do soon, or somewhere they need to go.
This is also a great chapter for the characters to express premises.

This chapter is an opportunity for players to elaborate their characters'
relationships, interests, and skills.
Provide a sandbox to play in, let the players establish what their
characters value here in the sandbox. Try to give them some choices that
express themes of the Touchstone List. Will they choose harmony over
freedom? Freedom over peace? Peace over progress?

### The Threat

While this is playing out, reveal that something valuable is threatened.
This valuable thing is often The Hearth itself, but it could be many things,
up to and including the known universe. If you are ever struggling to decide,
just choose The Hearth or ask the table.

The threat might be revealed by an NPC that acts as a "Herald".
This is someone that appears with a message about something from the
mysterious world where it is dangerous to venture. Usually this mysterious
world or one of it's denziens is the force behind the threat.

 * The village medium
 * A raven arrives from the neighboring kingdom
 * A ragged wanderer appears out of the wilderness

The threat might be revealed by using the game rules and playing out a
challenge that the PCs cannot *yet* overcome. If this plays out as combat,
be honest about the size of this threat - the PCs may fight something they
cannot subdue. It may result in their defeat and incapacitation.

### The Mission

Establishing the need serves a purpose for both the narrative and for the *game*.
The characters *need* the things they will get when the players *play* the game.

 * Maybe the characters are defeated in a first encounter
   * The players **need** more power, in a broad sense
 * Maybe a spell or skill would exploit the threat's weakness
   * The players **need** more moves / items
 * Maybe characters' knowledge is lacking
   * The players **need** information from the mysterious world
 * Maybe characters' place of comfort is exposed as insufficient
   * The players **need** a dangerous place to grow / explore / stretch their legs

This unstoppable threat should come alongside a suggestion of hope. NPCs can
be very useful to propose this last thread of hope.

 * "The Oracle will know what to do, she always knows."
 * "Khalrielle perished in the badlands, but maybe her sword survived."
 * The Herald makes a promise or proposes a trade
 * A command from a superior: "Come with me, and do your part. We shall prevail."

When it seems clear that the PCs are aligned towards a common goal, ask the
table to formulate their goal as a 2-6 word phrase. When this is decided, write
the phrase down on the same sheet as the Touchstone List.
If you do this, gain a *Journey point* and aim to move the plot to the next
phase.

This threatening force will progress no matter the characters' choices and will
pervade the narrative. A common narrative device in movies is "The Refusal of
the Call" wherein the protagonists deny the Call to Adventure. If the PCs
refuse their call, continue ramping up the tension and expose the downsides of
that choice. It will lead naturally to Chapter 3.


<a name="9-hour-ch-3" />
## Chapter 3: Go

**AKA: Threshold and Threshold Guardian**

In the 9-hour campaign, run Chapter 3 just like you would in the "Cross a
Threshold" chapter of the One-shot campaign. The *Journey point* is gained
when the PCs cross a threshold with a true choice.
See [Chapter 2 of the One-Shot Campaign](#one-shot-ch-2)

In a 9-hour campaign, the characters might have built up a little more
XP or other resources than they would have in the One-shot campaign. One
way to make the threshold-crossing choice more dramatic is to set up
a resource-depleting challenge that blocks the threshold. This challenge
is called a "Threshold Guardian" and is often expressed in the narrative
as a literal guardian - some kind of monster.

Another way to dramatize the threshold crossing is to make the choice about
whether or not to enter the mysterious world *alone*. Maybe the portal is
closing, maybe their NPC allies are buying them time. Maybe these PC
halflings are the only ones who will fit into the goblin armor.

<a name="9-hour-ch-4" />
## Chapter 4: Search

**AKA: Road of Trials**

**AKA: Fun & Games**

The characters have now entered a situation that is not ordinary, not
comfortable. There is mystery here, unknowns, new people, new territory.
Their old coping mechanisms and skills will not have the same effectiveness
as before. Consequences will change and heighten. New skills will be
learned, new friendships established. New enemies will emerge.

The **Search** should deliver "the promise of the premise". Go back to
your Touchstone List and ask yourself some questions. What is the "juice" here?
What spectacle, what adventure might the players have been fantasizing about
when they chose the titles you see on this list? Don't be shy about copying.

### Allot Shadow Points

To begin the **Search** chapter of the story, circle **half** of your
*Shadow points*.

This new mysterious is dangerous. The circled *Shadow points* represent
this. Show the players that they might need to be smarter now. Problems are
not solved here as easily as in the place of comfort.

### New Problems, New Solutions

At least once during the **Search**, give each player a chance to use the
Study Under a Master or Shop / Procure moves and give each player a chance to
use the skill or item they chose.

### The Power and Magic of the Mysterious World

Make an exhibition of how this world has power unlike their place of comfort.
There are forces here that aren't understood. Those forces can be scary, yes,
but they can also be miraculous.

Use one of your *Journey points* to make this exhibition.

### Finishing the Search

You achieve your GM goal in the **Search** phase if

 * you gave each player a chance to "level up" their character and use their
   new skills or items
 * and you used at least one *Journey point*
 * and you used all the circled *Shadow points* you circled at the beginning

If you do this, gain a *Journey point* and aim to move the plot to the next
phase.


<a name="9-hour-ch-5" />
## Chapter 5: Find

**AKA: Dark night of the soul**

**AKA: Find the Hero within**

When the narrative arrives at a point of relative quiet or peace, maybe
during a Seek Help or Rest move, have an honest conversation with your
players.

This is a time for total vulnerability, weightlessness, and revelation.
It is a time for the entire identity of the protagonists to "hang in the
balance.
Using dreamlike and mystical imagery in your exposition can be a great way
to dress the stage.

Taking a moment to change the background music can be especially effective
in Chapter 5.

Tell your players how you interpret the plot so far. Revisit where they've
been, reinforce where they've arrived and say what it all means to you.
Not as the sole author of a story, but as an interpreter of your shared
authorship. Tell them how you see their characters, what they value, what
they might represent metaphorically.

Go around to each player and ask them

 * What direction forward does your character see as possible from here, or
   does your character want to just stay right where they are?
 * Will your character sacrifice their life for something valuable in the
   plot? If so, what, and why?
 * Have the events of this journey caused your character to give up a
   "premise" -- a *fundamental* belief or relationship they held at the
   beginning of the game?

Make a note of all the answers.

Next, ask any players still using the "Lucky" Stamina system if they're ready
to switch over to the "Heroic" Stamina system. This is an opportunity for a
player to gain more control in exchange for higher difficulty. If they say yes,
make a note of it.

If each character answered "stay", "sacrifice", or "abandon" to any of the
questions above, or if any player switched from "Lucky" to "Heroic", gain
a *Journey point*.


<a name="9-hour-ch-6" />
## Chapter 6: Take & Pay

**AKA: The Ordeal**

Just before this chapter, if you can give the players an opportunity to gain
new skills or equipment for their characters, you should. They're going to
need it.

The characters have learned something in this mysterious place that is
the key to both worlds. Maybe they learned something about themselves, maybe
they received a great boon or symbol. Maybe they met a goddess that whispered
a secret of the universe. Maybe they met their father. It could be something
very literal, like the skill they just learned or a spear enchanted to pass
through dragon's hide.

This is the thing that will answer the **Need**.

### Allot Shadow Points

When you're ready, set up a challenge in the narrative, then draw a circle
around **all** of the unused *Shadow points* on your GM sheet.
To earn the *Journey point* of this chapter, use all the circled points
before the characters get a chance to Rest.

### Death Is Real Here

Just as in the One-Shot campaign's Chapter 3, in this Chapter, the consequence
for full Stamina loss is death.


<a name="9-hour-ch-7" />
## Chapter 7: Return

Start a conversation.

This is a time to consider grief and acceptance.

Ask the players what their characters will miss most about the world they're
leaving behind. NPCs left behind? A fellow PC that died? It can be anything.

Then ask the players how their characters will be received when they return.
Was a **Need** established in Chapter 2, and if so, will the characters be
able to answer it? Will the people of the ordinary world accept the characters
back? Will they accept whatever treasure might have been found in Chapter 6?
Will the dragon-piercing spear actually work against the dragon?

What changes have happened in the familiar world, with our heroes being gone
so long?

Did a player's character die in an earlier chapter? Will their friends and
family accept the survivors?

Maybe the answers aren't clear, and you need to set up scenes and get everyone
to flesh them out.

Bring the story to a threshold. A doorway that will seal shut once crossed.
A monster that once slain, will change everything forever. A volcano that must
be extinguished or exploded.

Build one final challenge for your players, a "Threshold Guardian".
This can be a mob of villagers whose minds must be changed, it can be their
cleverest adversary, or it can be that invulnerable dragon.

Gain a *Journey point* if you confront the PCs with a monster, challenge,
or obstacle that embodies:

 * grief: anger, bargaining, depression, denial
 * rejection of how the characters have changed
 * rejection of emotional growth
 * rejection that this story must end


<a name="9-hour-ch-8" />
## Chapter 8: Change

**AKA: Freedom from the fear of death**

When the characters return back to the ordinary world, they will have to
defeat the Threshold Guardian, or if that chapter was skipped, they will have
to come to terms with where they've been and who they are now.

A game of 1kFA can resolve in many ways. Where does their new
power lie? Game mechanisms? Relationships? Knowledge? Something else?

### The Chapter 8 Move: Reveal The Hearth

The first time any PC:

 * employs skills or treasures the they attained during their adventure
   to defeat the Threshold Guardian
 * attempts to banish something alien that came through the threshold by
   using a gift they attained in the mysterious world
 * inspires an NPC from the ordinary world to be something more, to cast
   away who they've been historically and to change.
 * wishes for something left behind on the other side of the threshold
 * presumes they are doomed, but chooses to defy death and struggle on

Use a *Journey point* to Reveal The Hearth. The Hearth was the
specific people, food, song, environmental feature, ritual or festival,
or group activity that was identified at the beginning of the game.

Describe how The Hearth which has been inaccessible, snuffed out, or hidden
since the characters crossed the first threshold is now rekindled, reborn,
re-imagined or its inheritor is revealed. All the PCs now have a chance to
fully heal their wounds.

For every wound healed, gain another *Journey point*.


# 30-hour Campaign

A 30-hour campaign is a trilogy of 9-hour campaigns, called "Books", with
slight rules tweaks in the Book 2 and Book 3.

Book 1 will play just the same as the 9-hour campaign. The PCs
will venture from their original home into a mysterious world, and return.

## Book 2

At the beginning of Book 2, make a new GM Sheet. Copy over any
leftover *Journey points* and *Shadow points* from Book 1 onto
this sheet.

During Chapter 7 of Book 2, the PCs do not return to their original home.
They return to a place that has some elements of their original home,
but it is not where they came from.

These elements may include:

 * Characters (friends and family)
 * Safety and comfort (even if temporary)
 * The Hearth

Only gain a *Journey point* during Chapter 7 if the threshold they cross
brings them to a place like this.

## Book 3

At the beginning of Book 3, make a new GM Sheet. Copy over any
leftover *Shadow points* from Book 2 onto this sheet. This Book starts
with **zero** *Journey points*.

In Book 3, *Shadow points* grow at double the normal rate:

 * ✅︎ gains you 2 *Shadow points*
 * on *FAST* moves, ✗ gains you 4 *Shadow points*

Chapter 7 of Book 3 can return the PCs to their original home or wherever
makes narrative sense.

In this Book, show downsides of the narrative character changes made earlier.
Will the characters give up their earlier accomplishments or boons to
attempt for even greater ones?

Try creating some monsters with immunities specific to the PCs' strengths.
How will the PCs react if the prizes earned in their earlier adventures are
rendered useless?


# The real juice

When you gather with friends you care about, sit around a table, and tell
stories, you are sharing in a great power.

There is a second journey that happens during play, and that is the journey
that the players are on. Not the *characters*. The *players*.

Every thought, idea, action expressed in the narrative came from a player, one
of your friends. Even the most ephemeral or small contribution is special
because it was unique to that person in that context.

If you want to make a game of 1kFA really great, pay attention to
*who* your friends are and guess at *why* they are expressing their character
the way they do. Then use those guesses in the story.

This power, this "juice", this "second journey", is difficult to fully
express in words. The narrative you create together is a means to explore
*the human experience*. To exist *in the moment*. Create a model of
reality, drop an avatar for yourself into it, distance your "real" self from
it, and **play** at being different. Be free to express anger, affection,
pain, the whole field of emotion, even that territory that is kept
walled-off to cope with everyday life and behave harmoniously in society.

Just like the fictional characters who cross over to a mysterious world,
face the unknown, and return to the ordinary world, we players can choose to
cross over and **play**, explore our unconsciousness, and find ourselves
changed by what we confronted, unchained, poked, or set free down there.

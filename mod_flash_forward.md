# Flash Forward

Do you want to run a game where the characters are at a high level?

Flash Forward is a GM move that lets you move the characters up levels
faster.  It is a very powerful move, and it should be used sparingly.

Like other hard GM moves, you can only use this when a player flips ✗✗.

----

Tell the players you'd like to do a Flash Forward.

Go around the table
and give each player a chance to cancel the Flash Forward by spending
one green token. The player that spent the green token continues the
scene, and the Flash Forward doesn't happen.  This can be a costly move
for a player, because the GM is likely to attempt a Flash Forward the
next time a flip of ✗✗ happens, so there must be something very
worthwhile in the current scene or setting for that player, so the GM
may try to give the player at least some level of satisfaction in
whatever they're pursuing before the next Flash Forward, or the GM
may abandon the Flash Forward entirely.

Ask the players to name 2 threats in this world that need dealing with.
These threats can be either single or collective. They can be monsters
("the finery golem"), NPCs ("the Fendlor twins"), even whole
societies ("the marsh gnomes")

Ask the players to name 2 settings in this world their characters have
yet to see.
These can be names of new steadings ("Fairdwell and Cullbtown"),
place names that already exist on a map, a place in the
wilderness ("the eagle's roost", "Hobart's fallen monument")
or even just a new room in a building they're in.

Finally, ask the players to name 2 steadings in this world.

Next tell a story about how the players traveled through these new
settings and vanquished the named threat. Spend a minute or two on
how each character played a role in this adventure. Be faithful to
the personalities, strengths, and weaknesses of each character.
Close by saying how they arrived at the named steading.

Give each player 3 green tokens and invite them to use their steading
moves.

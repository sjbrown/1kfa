# Time Traveller's Convention

**REMINDER: Always check the lemma**

This game is about everything that's really important -- being honest, lonliness, and having friends you can tell the truth to. And not creating any fucking time paradoxes.

A time travel LARP
 * This LARP *is* the screening process for the time travel society
 * Just as Continuum was
   * That's possible because time travel is a power that transcends boundaries like "capitalism" (and also it transcends time, but, that's, like, right there in the title)
 * The reason you're reading this is because someone playing this game will become a time traveller, and either you're one of them, or it was necessary for them to play with *you* to create the specific timeline where they became that time traveller.
 * Their future selves (me! hello!) made sure of that. When time isn't a boundary, you can kinda do what you want in these realms.
 * Confused? It only really makes sense when you consider the "meta-fractal" of information.
 * Reality is a fountain of ever-generating information.  It "tries" everything that's possible, then any information configurations that self-perpetuate, do so. One configuration that did so, is this one - the one containing the time dimension. The meta-fractal *birthed* time. When you become a time traveller, you are free to move in the time dimension, but you still exist inside the boundaries of the meta-fractal.
 * The meta-fractal is like an infinitely growing tree. Sometimes a branch on a tree dies, but the whole tree keeps on growing. You don't want to be one of those branches destined to die, because unlike time (you'll understand this later), the meta-fractal goes on forever, and nobody wants to be dying forever.
 * One known way that branches die is by "paradoxes" \*\*. So, as a rule, we travellers don't "create paradoxes". That's another reason why you're finding out this way, because it was one of the ways that didn't create a paradox.
 * Ugh, it is so aggrivating to say "create paradox" - it's a poor abstraction - don't learn that too deeply.  The actual truth will be explained later.
 * Here's the rub - you can never prove if you're on a branch that's dying, because, on the meta-fractal, that proof's existence - to be very hand-wavy about it - would be information from which a choice could be made, which would create a branching, which, for a time traveller, would allow you to escape the dying branch, which would prove you're not on a dying branch - and that contradicts the original proof, which, on the meta-fractal is not impossible, but it does make your higher-order branch die.
 * There's even a theory that a sufficiently survival-minded time traveler could perpetuate their escape from death in a way that made the whole meta-fractal collapse.
 * Listen, that's not going to make much sense yet, but the good news is that once we figured out the "time machine" a resulting lemma let us *approximate* whether we are approaching dying branches. With that tool it's possible to practice safe time-travelling.
 * Every time you write or talk about time travelling, at least once, remind everyone to **always check the lemma**. That might not seem like an important rule, and omitting it doesn't cause dying branches *by logical consequence*, but it's a rule that makes your brain into a brain with strong lemma-checking reinforcement, and that actually does prevent dying branches.
 * This is in the form of a LARP because
   1. that's what we were interested in at the time, and
   2. the game teaches the basic skills I'll need to build the "time machine"\*
 * I'm being vague about who I am because it's important that I not know I'm a time traveller at this point, otherwise I wouldn't have become one.
 * I'm being vague, but I am telling the truth. It's another weird rule that emerges, actually. I have no choice but to, time travellers can't lie to other time travellers. It would "c" a "p".


* "time machine" is really a dumb way of saying it, but that's a shorthand way to phrase it that makes sense to my brain at this stage. Saying what it actually was wouldn't make any sense to me and wouldn't attract my attention.

** Ugh, another one of these.



# Game Rules

 * Go into a room of 4-6 other people, who have all agreed to play, and convince them you know more about time travelling than one other person in that room.
 * Do this regularly.  Do it in different locations, and do it with different groups of people.
 * Leave the room in "exactly 1.5 hours", or when you've all come to a consensus about who knows more than who. Afterwards, refrain from any convincing rhetoric for "exactly one hour"
 * The purpose of the game is:
   * Oh, look!  I put those two phrases in quotation marks! Almost as if the relationship between "rules" and "time" are important!  Maybe that's a clue!
   * In your existence, you will need to convince people. This will start teaching you how hard it is, but also how rewarding when you actually succeed.
   * This game will force you to educate yourself.
   * You could not have generated everything you need for the "time machine" without the ideas you got from interacting with other people while playing this game.
   * Being who you are will mean a certain kind of lonliness, and this is hard to hear and to write. But this game does actually work, and you will *really* need to be able to cope.
   * One purpose of the game is a secret. Aren't I a mysterious bullet point? Aren't I a redundant question mark?
 * Convince other people to play the game.

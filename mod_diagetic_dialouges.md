# Diegetic Dialogue

Diegetic Dialogue is a technique that immerses you deeper in the game
world by using in-character role-playing to handle game rules and answer
the game's questions.

Instead of pausing the adventure to and stepping outside the roles of
the heroes to address the mechanisms of the game, you may weave those
procedures directly into your in-character interactions. This technique,
where the questions posed by the game are answered and its processes
enacted through dialogue and roleplaying, deepens your immersion and
makes the world feel truly alive.

By answering, for example, "What is the ambiance of this ancient ruin?"
through one of these four voices, you shape the tone and the pace of
the game:

 * **Player Voice**: "This scene is all about mystery and the
   foreboding feeling of a powerful place, untouched for generations.
   Its secrets are covered in dust and cobwebs drape from every corner"
 * **Narrator Voice**: "The air hangs heavy with the scent of ages,
   the guide cautiously descends the stairs, tearing delicate strands
   of spider silk that drape across crumbling archways and statuary"
 * **Character Voice**: "Ugh, can't swing a cat without hitting a
   cobweb in this place. And it smells like… well, old stones and
   forgotten secrets.'"
 * **Character-to-Character Voice**:
   * **Player A (as Elara the Elf)**: "Cobwebs! Ptah! Do you sense
     anything, Kaelen? The air feels… dead."
   * **Player B (as Kaelen the Mystic)**: "Not death, but an
     unfathomable slumber. As if time itself has settled heavily
     upon these stones."

You have the freedom to choose which voice to use at any time.
Player Voice is the most straightforward, and can reduce cognitive
load, especially for new players.
Narrator voice is the default for the GM, and especially common when
setting up a scene.
Character voice enhances immersion, and Character-to-Character voice
elevates that feeling even further.

Character-to-Character voice can be used to *build up* answers to the
game's questions. When the game presents a question, 
use your character's dialogue to explore it and find the answer
interactively with other players.
Simply start an in-character dialogue contribution, and let your fellow
players follow suit. This method is a delightful mental juggling act,
embodying your character's personality while working with your fellow
players to satisfy the game's needs.
Each line of dialogue becomes a building block, inspiring the next, and
guiding you organically toward a shared understanding.

There is no *best* voice.  The game will be formed by the players together
and they can choose which voices to use, to create a more forward-charging
and mechanical experience, or a immersive and embodied experience. What
do the players find most rewarding? What challenges do they want to
concentrate on? Diegetic Dialogues is a tool to be wielded to the table's
preferences.

Ultimately, the 'best' voice is the one that enhances your group's
enjoyment. Whether you favor a direct, mechanical approach or a deeply
immersive experience, Diegetic Dialogue is a versatile tool. Use it to
shape your game, remembering that even as your characters speak and
interact, the game's rules provide the framework for your shared story –
the silent voice of Destiny guiding your adventure.

# The Narrative Authority Waterfall

**The Narrative Authority Waterfall** describes how storytelling flows
around the table: from the Game Master (GM) outward to the players, then
back again—like a cascade. It should feel like a conversation, a structured
rhythm, with a mild hierarchy. When the game calls upon the GM, they may
take the task entirely to themselves, or instead invite the table into
the current, to add their own creativity, questions, or elaboration.
Everyone’s contributions are always bound by the rules of the game, 
the solid basin of earth and rock that shapes and contains the current.

This principle applies to all parts of the game—worldbuilding, roleplay,
mechanical resolution, and narrative development.

## The GM Has First Say

When called upon by the rules, or by the expectant silence of the players,
the GM speaks first. Their duty is to keep the story moving along according
to the Campaign Guide and to keep the pace of play steady.
It is the GM's privileged position to lead the creation of the narrative.
But this role doesn’t require narrative virtuosity or constant spontaneity.
It is completely acceptable to immediately throw it open to the table at
those moments, and merely facilitate.  What's important is that questions
about what’s happening, what’s at stake, what’s changing are answered
by *someone*.

## Contributions Flow from the Table

The GM invites others to add to at any moment: describing a location,
proposing a complication, imagining a cultural detail, or building on what’s
just happened. These additions are accepted through **mutual assent**—a
shared sense that the contribution fits the setting of the Touchstone List,
feels right, and respects the moment.

Players are encouraged to offer ideas, and GMs are empowered to accept,
adapt, or redirect them. This relieves pressure from the GM to carry the
creative burden alone. It creates space for GMs to *listen* as well as lead.

## The Rules Contain the Flow

All contributions—GM and player alike—must stay within the **boundaries of
the game's written rules**.
This ensures consistency, fairness, and the feeling that outcomes are
earned, not improvised without cost.

Whether it's interpreting a flip, introducing new character details, or
defining a new piece of lore, the contributions must:

 * Follow the structure laid out in the game
 * Feel true to the world of the Touchstone List
 * Honor what the mechanics allow or prohibit
 * Avoid overriding consequences already in play

The rules aren’t barriers to storytelling—they’re the frame that makes
shared creativity stable and meaningful.

By flowing within these boundaries, every idea gains structure, and every
twist earns its place in the story.

## Waterfall, Not Podium

The Narrative Authority Waterfall allows narrative responsibility to flow,
not pool. The GM provides guidance, but the table shapes the current. No one
needs to be brilliant on command. The rules provide structure. The group
provides momentum. The story is something you all discover together—through
intention, response, and shared creative trust.

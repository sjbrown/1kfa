# Scenes and Stakes

In storytelling - whether in novels or film - scenes are the building blocks
of the narrative. Each scene presents a specific situation where
protagonists want something, face opposition, and either succeed, fail, or
pivot toward a new goal.
Stakes are the assets (physical, social or informational) that will be won or
lost as the scene progresses. Stakes are central to scenes: they define what’s
on the line and give the events emotional weight.

The following procedures translate those narrative principles into a
collaborative, mechanical structure, helping the table build a dynamic story
together.

Scenes form around a shared dramatic question: What do the characters want,
and what might happen if they get it - or don’t?

Winning or losing stakes always shifts the story forward. They're
not abstract goals - they’re tangible, achievable objectives like "secure the
alliance" or "find the back door into the castle."
Winning or losing the stakes determines how the next chapter will begin for
the protagonists - whether they will meet that chapter open-eyed and
prepared, or be dragged into its pages by cruel fate.

As you create and play through scenes, remember: every scene matters, risks
should feel real, and both triumphs and failures carry story weight.
Players aren’t just solving problems - they’re co-authoring a plot full of
tension, consequence, and change.


## Components for a scene

 * The scene page
   * Title
   * primary ✔ progress bar
   * secondary ✔ progress bar(s)
   * skull progress bar
   * (optional) notes
 * Names of the stakes
 * ✔ tokens
 * shadow ✓ tokens
 * GM Move deck

The progress bars track rising and falling tension. Success earns
narrative control and resolution; failure introduces complications, twists,
and setbacks.

The GM Move Deck acts as a tool for escalating drama, injecting new
developments, or adding pressure when things go wrong - mirroring the kind of
beats you'd see in a screenplay’s midpoint reversal or at a novel’s crisis.


## Procedures for a scene

1. A "scene" is created and described by using the Narrative Authority Waterfall to
answer the following questions:

 * What do the characters need to advance the story?
 * Where is an interesting location of the setting to pursue this need?
 * What content from the Touchstone List is present here?
 * What significant set pieces are in front of the characters?
 * What obstacles (if any) are blocking the obvious routes?
 * Besides the characters, who else is present?
 * What details of this location are obvious and notable to the characters?
 * What is the ambiance? Which environmental subtleties might the characters notice? Music? Smells?

Additional questions and rules for creating scenes will be found in the Campaign
Guide for the specific chapter the story is in.
Those sections will inform:

 * The size of the primary ✔ progress bar
 * The size of the skull progress bar
 * What an appropriate primary "stake" would be

When all the questions are answered, the table should share an
understanding of where the PCs are situated, and players will start
forming ideas on how to contribute to the upcoming Dramatic Action.

Create a title for this scene using the information you now have from answering
the questions above.

Create the "scene page" from a blank sheet of paper, write the scene's
title at the top of the page.  Then draw the primary ✔ progress bar and the skull
progress bar.

Shuffle the GM Move Deck just before beginning a scene. Typically this deck has
thirteen cards, but its composition can be modified by chapter-specific rules.
Check the Campaign Guide if any modification is necessary.

2. One "stake" is attached to the primary ✔ progress bar

To ensure a focused and impactful scene, a Primary Stake is defined.
The Primary Stake is the central goal the party aims to achieve within
that scene. Think of it as the driving question: "What must the heroes
accomplish *here* to progress on their quest?"

 * Information
   * eg, learning the villain's plans
 * A McGuffin / a tool / a key
   * eg, components for a magic ritual must be gathered
 * An ally / an alliance
   * eg, rescuing someone from a trap to earn their loyalty
 * Neutralization of a threat
   * eg, sabotaging the enemy's war machines
 * Access to a location or path
   * eg, navigating through a treacherous swamp
 * Reputation or social status change
   * eg, being initiated into a secret organization

Follow these steps to set the scene's Primary Stake:

 * Consult the list of categories and suggestions above
 * Consult the chapter-dependent rules
 * Consider applying the Narrative Authority Waterfall and Diegetic
   Dialogues tools
 * The GM will declare when the stake has resolved in their mind.
 * Allow some time for clarifying questions, if necessary.
 * Everyone at the table should now understand "what's at stake".
 * Create a short name for the stake and write it next to the
   primary ✔ progress bar

The stake and its name can get re-worked or refined as the narrative develops
during a scene. Such revision should increase the specificity of the stake.
For example, it can start as "castle information" and get updated to
"castle backdoor secret".

A well-defined Primary Stake provides direction, creates tension, and makes
the outcome of the scene meaningful. While smaller objectives may arise,
the Primary Stake remains the core focus.

3. The Dramatic Action begins

With the scene and stakes understood, it's time for the players to take
the reins and initiate the dramatic action. Begin by situating the
characters' position within the scene. Are they charging into battle?
Surveying the landscape from afar? Once established, the GM will
direct the spotlight to a player, prompting them with the inciting
question: "What do you do?"

The PCs' actions and dialogue drive the plot and trigger Player Moves 
(see SECTION X). The results of these moves, in turn, determine how the
scene evolves:

 1. ✔✔ Double success
    * two ✔ tokens are added to a ✔ progress bar
 2. ✔ Success
    * one ✔ token is added to a ✔ progress bar
 3. ✓ Success & Shadow
    * one shadow ✓ token is added to a ✔ progress bar
 4. ✗ Failure
    * all shadow ✓ tokens are removed from all progress bars and put in the
      GM's collection of Shadow Points
    * Trigger the GM Move Deck (which may increment the skull progress bar)

When there are multiple ✔ progress bars, the GM chooses how to assign the
tokens based on the intent and narrative outcome of the Player Move.

Thus, as the scene plays out, the progress bars gradually fill.  The scene ends
when either the scene's primary progress bar or the skull progress bar are
completed.


### Triggering The GM Move Deck

The GM has a deck of cards that they draw from when a Player hits an ✗.

Depending on chapter rules, there are about 3 skull cards in the deck.
The other cards are:

 1. Deal damage / Expend stamina & Reshuffle the GM Move Deck
 2. Show signs of an approaching threat
 3. Escalate the danger / Trigger a combat interlude
 4. Reveal an unwelcome truth
 5. Offer an opportunity, with a cost
 6. Turn their move back on them
 7. Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask
 8. Show a downside to their appearance, reputation, or equipment
 9. Use up their resources
 10. Separate them
 11. Shadow
 12. Shadow
 13. Shadow
 14. (Only in certain chapters) Shadow
 15. (Only in certain chapters) Death
     * Only causes a character death if flipped *with* another Shadow card,
       otherwise, it kills a friendly NPC, if no such NPC, it just acts as
       a Shadow card.

On an ✗, two cards are revealed from the GM Move Deck, and either:

 1. Any of the revealed cards is a Shadow card:
    * Ignore the revealed 1-10 card (if any)
    * Increment the skull progress bar 
    * Invoke the chapter-specific rules from the Campaign Guide
 2. Two of the 1-10 cards are revealed
    * Using Narrative Authority Waterfall, choose *one* of the two cards and
      narrate events into the scene that interpret the card
    * Refer to PAGE X for additional guidance and suggestions for interpreting
      the narrative effects of these cards.

When the skull progress increments, something negative happens, determined
by the Chapter rules, and can include such things as:

 * Addition of a secondary stake with its own progress bar
 * Replacement of the primary stake with a less valuable stake
 * Loss of the primary stake
 * Jeapordizing something the characters already posess by making it a stake
 * The forced start of a combat
   * See PAGE X for rules on starting a combat


### Filling the primary ✔ progress bar

There are two ways the primary stake of the scene can be won:

 * When the players fill the ✔ progress bar
   * When this happens, the achievement of the stakes and a scene epilogue
     shall be narrated using the Narrative Authority Waterfall
 * When demanded by the state of the narrative
   * Narrative is primary.  If the facts of the scene are such that there's
     no other outcome than the achievement of the stakes, those become the
     facts of the story
   * In this case, a new stake or boon may be created for the party to
     achieve in this scene.  This is likely some "bonus" or "treasure" not
     tightly tied to the needs of the story


### Filling a secondary stake's ✔ progress bar

When a secondary stake's progress bar is filled, the party achieves
that benefit.

### Filling the skull progress bar

When the skull progress bar is filled, the scene is "blundered" by the party.

How can a scene end in a bad outcome while the plot still moves forward?

 * The stake is only partially won
   * It is fragmented or corrupted
   * It will take additional resources to realize its benefits
 * Betrayed by a supposed friend
 * Permanent loss of one or more of the stakes
 * One of the lost stakes moves forward to a future scene
 * Death of an ally
 * Betrayal - new shadow force
   * In all future scenes, "overcome _blank_ force" stake card is added
   * With a progress bar of 3.
 * Ironic reversal - what the characters sought in a stake gets reversed
 * Haste - the party loses their next opportunity for Downtime
 * Trigger an Fallout combat interlude
 * An overpowering force transports the party to a new location


# Combat interlude

Adversaries are created with Stamina progress bars, per formula.

## When a combat interlude begins

 * Gather up all the cards of the GM Move deck
 * Remove the Shadow cards and replace them with the combat-specific Deal Damage cards

## When a combat interlude ends

 * Gather up all the cards of the Combat deck
 * Remove the combat-specific Deal Damage cards and replace them with the Shadow cards

The GM Move Deck instead of "Shadow" cards, has "Deal Damage" cards

The GM Move deck is shuffled going into and exiting from a combat interlude, so
triggering combat can be a way for players to avoid an upcoming Shadow or
Death card.

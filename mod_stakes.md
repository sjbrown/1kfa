# Scenes and Stakes

In storytelling - whether in novels or film - scenes are the building blocks
of the narrative. Each scene presents a specific situation where
protagonists want something, face opposition, and either succeed, fail, or
pivot toward a new goal.
Stakes are the assets (physical, social or informational) that will be won or
lost as the scene progresses. Stakes are central to scenes: they define what’s
on the line and give the events emotional weight.

The following procedures translate those narrative principles into a
collaborative, mechanical structure, helping the table build a dynamic story
together.

Scenes form around a shared dramatic question: What do the characters want,
and what might happen if they get it - or don’t?

Winning or losing stakes always shifts the story forward. They're
not abstract goals - they’re tangible, achievable objectives like "secure the
alliance" or "find the back door into the castle."
Winning or losing the stakes determines how the next chapter will begin for
the protagonists - whether they will meet that chapter open-eyed and
prepared, or be dragged into its pages by cruel fate.

As you create and play through scenes, remember: every scene matters, risks
should feel real, and both triumphs and failures carry story weight.
Players aren’t just solving problems - they’re co-authoring a plot full of
tension, consequence, and change.


## Components for a scene

 * The scene page
   * Title
   * ✔ progress bar
   * skull progress bar
   * (optional) notes
 * Stakes card(s)
 * ✔ tokens
 * shaow ✓ tokens
 * GM Move deck

The progress bars track rising tension and narrative direction. Success earns
narrative control and resolution; failure introduces complications, twists,
and sometimes outright setbacks.

The GM Move Deck acts as a tool for escalating drama, injecting new
developments, or adding pressure when things go wrong - mirroring the kind of
beats you'd see in a screenplay’s midpoint reversal or at a novel’s crisis.


## Procedures for a scene

1. A "scene" is created and described by using the Narrative Authority Waterfall to
answer the following questions:

 * What do the characters need to advance the story?
 * Where is an interesting location of the setting to pursue this need?
 * What are scenes from the Touchstone List that have content that could be lifted?
 * What significant set pieces are in front of the characters?
 * What obstacles might be present?
 * Besides the characters, who else is present?  (Who might oppose the characters?)
 * What details of this location are obvious and notable to the characters?
 * Are there any environmental subtleties of note?  Music? Smells?


Additional questions and rules for creating scenes will be found in the Campaign
Guide for the specific chapter the story is in.
Those sections will inform:

 * The size of the ✔ progress bar
 * The size of the skull progress bar
 * What an appropriate "stakes" card would be

Create a title for this scene using the information you now have from answering
the questions.

Create the "scene page" from a blank sheet of paper, write the scene's
title at the top of the page.

Shuffle the GM Move Deck just before beginning a scene. Typically this deck has
thirteen cards, but its composition can be modified by chapter-specific rules.
Check the Campaign Guide if any modification is necessary.

2. One "stake" is attached to the scene

This first "stake" is something the party wants to achieve in the scene to
beneficially move the plot forward.

 * Information
 * A McGuffin / a tool
 * An ally / an alliance
 * Neutralization of a threat
 * Access to a location or path
 * Reputation or social status change

Follow these steps to create a "stake" card:

 * Refer to chapter-dependent rules which sometimes provide further guidelines
 * Using the suggestion list above and the Narrative Authority Waterfall, decide
   on what the first stake should be.
 * Create a short name for the stake and write it on a card.
 * Place the card on top of the scene page

The stake and its name on the card can get refined as the narrative develops
during a scene.
For example, it can start as "castle information" and get updated to
"castle backdoor secret".

3. The Player characters make moves, working towards winning the stakes

As player characters make moves in the scene, those moves resolve to four
potential results

 1. ✔✔ Double success
    * two ✔ tokens are added to the scene's ✔ progress bar
 2. ✔ Success
    * one ✔ token is added to the scene's ✔ progress bar
 3. ✓ Success & Shadow
    * one shadow ✓ token is added to the scene's ✔ progress bar
 4. ✗ Failure
    * all shadow ✓ tokens are removed from the scene's ✔ progress bar
    * Trigger the GM Move Deck (which may increment the skull progress bar)

Thus, as the scene plays out, the progress bars gradually fill.  The scene ends
when one of the bars is completed.


### Triggering The GM Move Deck

The GM has a deck of cards that they draw from when a Player hits an ✗.

Depending on chapter rules, there are about 3 skull cards in the deck.
The other cards are:

 1. Deal damage / Expend stamina & Reshuffle the GM Move Deck
 2. Show signs of an approaching threat
 3. Escalate the danger / Trigger a combat scene
 4. Reveal an unwelcome truth
 5. Offer an opportunity, with a cost
 6. Turn their move back on them
 7. Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask
 8. Show a downside to their appearance, reputation, or equipment
 9. Use up their resources
 10. Separate them
 11. Shadow
 12. Shadow
 13. Shadow
 14. (Only in certain chapters) Shadow
 15. (Only in certain chapters) Death
     * Only causes a character death if flipped *with* another Shadow card,
       otherwise, it kills a friendly NPC, if no such NPC, it just acts as
       a Shadow card.

On an ✗, two cards are revealed from the GM Move Deck, and either:

 1. Any number of Shadow cards are revealed
    * Ignore the 1-10 card (if any)
    * Increment the skull progress bar 
    * Invoke the chapter-specific rules from the Campaign Guide
 2. Two of the 1-10 cards are revealed
    * Using Waterfall Narrative Authority, choose one of the two cards and
      narrate events into the scene that interpret the card
    * Refer to PAGE X for additional guidance and suggestions for interpreting
      the narrative effects of these cards.

When the skull progress increments, something negative happens, determined
by the Chapter rules, and can include such things as:

 * Replacement of the stake with a less valuable stake
 * Loss of the stake
 * Introducing something the characters already posess as a new stake
 * The forced start of a combat
   * See PAGE X for rules on starting a combat

### Filling the ✔ progress bar

There are two ways the stakes of the scene can be achieved:

 * When the players fill the ✔ progress bar
   * When this happens, the achievement of the stakes and a scene epilogue
     shall be narrated using the Narrative Authority Waterfall
 * In a purely narrative fashion
   * Narrative is primary.  If the facts of the scene are such that there's
     no other outcome than the achievement of the stakes, those become the
     facts of the story
   * In this case, a new stake or boon may be created for the party to
     achieve in this scene.  This is likely some "bonus" or "treasure" not
     tightly tied to the needs of the story


### Filling the skull progress bar

When the skull progress bar is filled, the scene is "blundered" by the party.



# Combat scene

Adversaries are created with Stamina progress bars, per formula.

The GM Move Deck instead of "Shadow" cards, has "Deal Damage" cards

The GM Move deck is shuffled going into and exiting from a combat scene, so
triggering combat can be a way for players to avoid an upcoming Shadow or
Death card.

# Cliffhanger

Session must end with a cliffhanger

 * turn in drive / flag cards for exp
 * Do steading / teacher moves if steading / teacher are available
 * GM sets a timer for 2 minutes
 * GM then describes a scene that imperils the characters or something important to them
 * but if the timer goes off mid-description, the GM must immediately stop.

(This is to provide a feeling of cliffhanger for every player, even for the
GM who will be itching to finish the set-up they were in the middle of
describing)

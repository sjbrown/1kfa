# Deckahedron Module: Weapons


## Move: Craft a Weapon

At a steading, spend 2 META to create a weapon with *More Power* than your
current weapon.  Write the weapon's name and details on a blank card, and
give this card to the GM.

The GM will offer this card as one of the cards at your next Shop / Procure,
or make it available as loot in your next adventure.



## More Power

You should decide at the beginning of your game if your group is going
to play using polyhedral dice, or play diceless.  The weapon damage will
change depending on what you choose.

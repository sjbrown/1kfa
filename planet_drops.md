"The enemy gate is down". Ha!

You ship descends, face-first into the fusion-gushing star to absorb enough energy for FTL

Your accelerational compensators whir into action to defend your soft bio-bodies
against the trauma.

Screens off. Stay calm. Resist the urge to find comfort in "seeing where you're going".
The relativistic turtleneck of photons would only unnerve you further.

You personally did the integrity checks, the cubic acre of fuel is tied tight and the hull
is prepped to pivot & punch as always, at literally the last second.

You'll be fine; 1s is more than double what your Jury 3-Chip needs to run the calculation.

Don't pray. Don't pray... Damn your ghosts! Die brave and do. not. pray.

Time does a thing.

  * Game rules here [1]

The blackness turns off and new constellations turn on.

"Disorientation" doesn't cover it. You are a smeared-together parliament of thoughts that call
themselves "I" who pilot a mostly-liquid gene-dispersal system that evolved to *orient* itself
on a spinning sphere so many stars away you've stopped counting.

Every time, it feels like that dream that tricks you into thinking you've just awoken,
while other-also-self screams at you to wake up again.  For real, this time.

You move your hands. The procedure is always slow, every switch and setting feels like a
deadly mistake, but habit and logic push you through it.

You feel the ship turning, an image comes on the screen. A star, bright and yellow, and
half-dipped in its light, the subscreen, zoomed-in, shows: a semicircle of blue and white.

Jackpot.

Game rules:

  * Then you find yourselves (some score) away from the other targeted star system
  * If you fail, you "punch through" - legend says you'll end up in starless,
  inter-galactic space or, only by some miracle, in some other arm of the milky way
  (if it ever happens the players always end up in some other arm)

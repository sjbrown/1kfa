# Simple Attacking

## Attacking: Unopposed flips

Any attack where the foe is caught unaware is done by an unopposed flip.
The player taking the action:

 * Flips Dex (ranged weapon) or Str (handheld weapon)

Card shows | Consequences
-----------|--------------
 ✔✔        | deal 1d4 fatigue
 ✔         | deal 1d4 fatigue
 ✗         | miss
 ✗✗        | miss

In either case, the foe is now aware that the fight is on.


## Attacking: Opposed flips

### Ranged attacks:
This is modeled as a "volley" or "spray" attack.  The player should
account for ammo "points" for their weapon.  One of the consequences
can be to lose one of those ammo points.

In ranged combat is that, even when you don't hit an opponent, you can
cause them to stay in the cover they've got, dive for the floor, or
interrupt their current action.  Here, we'll call this "pinned"

# Deckahedron Module: Green Scenes

`TODO`

The GM has a deck of "scene" cards:

 * Humour
 * Emotional Depth
 * Callback
 * Action that effects change (+/- system from Save the Cat??)
 * Character that audience identifies as having a potential successful plan
   at the start of a scene ends up with that plan stymied
 * Irony: character's actions are properly motivated for success but the
   actions themselves cause a failure

## Steps:

1.  The GM shuffles these cards and lays them out face-up, behind a screen
so that the players cannot see them.

2. The GM places one green token on one of the cards (either by choice, or
randomly by rolling a d4)

## Play:

When a player takes a turn or otherwise contributes something that
satisfies the card that the token is on, that player gets the token and
puts it on their character sheet.  The GM then does steps 1 and 2 again.

When a player flips a ✗ or ✗✗ on their turn, the GM moves the green token
to the adjacent card.


# Deckahedron Module: Green Stories

The GM has a deck of "story" cards:

### Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet

```
but could also use
* Screenwriter's Bible
* Hero's Journey
* etc.
```

1. Opening Image – A visual that represents the struggle & tone of the story.
   A snapshot of the main character’s problem, before the adventure begins.
2. Set-up – Expand on the “before” snapshot. Present the main character’s world
   as it is, and what is missing in their life.
3. Theme Stated (happens during the Set-up) – What your story is about; the
   message, the truth. Usually, it is spoken to the main character or in their
   presence, but they don’t understand the truth... not until they have some
   personal experience and context to support it.
4. Catalyst – The moment where life as it is changes. It is the telegram, the
   act of catching your loved-one cheating, allowing a monster onboard the
   ship, meeting the true love of your life, etc. The “before” world is no
   more, change is underway.
5. Debate – But change is scary and for a moment, or a brief number of
   moments, the main character doubts the journey they must take. Can I face
   this challenge? Do I have what it takes? Should I go at all? It is the last
   chance for the hero to chicken out.
6. Break Into Two (Choosing Act Two) – The main character makes a choice and
   the journey begins. We leave the “Thesis” world and enter the upside-down,
   opposite world of Act Two.
7. B Story – This is when there’s a discussion about the Theme – the nugget of
   truth. Usually, this discussion is between the main character and the love
   interest. So, the B Story is usually called the “love story”.
8. Fun and Games / The Promise of the Premise –
   This is the fun part of the story. This is when
   Indiana Jones tries to beat the Nazis to the Lost Ark, when the detective
   finds the most clues and dodges the most bullets. This is when the main
   character explores the new world and the audience is entertained by the
   premise they have been promised.
9. Midpoint – Dependent upon the story, this moment is when everything is
   “great” or everything is “awful”. The main character either gets
   everything they think they want (“great”) or doesn’t get what they think
   they want at all (“awful”). But not everything we think we want is what we
   actually need in the end.
10. Bad Guys Close In – Doubt, jealousy, fear, foes both physical and
   emotional regroup to defeat the main character’s goal, and the main
   character’s “great”/“awful” situation disintegrates.
11. All is Lost – The opposite moment from the Midpoint: “awful”/“great”. The
   moment that the main character realizes they’ve lost everything they
   gained, or everything they now have has no meaning. The initial goal now
   looks even more impossible than before. And here, something or someone
   dies. It can be physical or emotional, but the death of something old makes
   way for something new to be born.
12. Dark Night of the Soul – The main character hits bottom, and wallows in
   hopelessness. The Why hast thou forsaken me, Lord? moment. Mourning the
   loss of what has “died” – the dream, the goal, the mentor character, the
   love of your life, etc. But, you must fall completely before you can pick
   yourself back up and try again.
13. Break Into Three (Choosing Act Three) – Thanks to a fresh idea, new
   inspiration, or last-minute Thematic advice from the B Story (usually the
   love interest), the main character chooses to try again.
14. Finale – This time around, the main character incorporates the Theme – the
   nugget of truth that now makes sense to them – into their fight for the
   goal because they have experience from the A Story and context from the B
   Story. Act Three is about Synthesis!
15. Final Image – opposite of Opening Image, proving, visually, that a change
   has occurred within the character.

# Deckahedron Module: Green Motivators

`Note to self: this could go into meta-cards`

Sort of like Alignment in Dungeon World

A player has a couple *Motivator* cards in front of them:

 * Preserve / Increase
 * Oppose / Decrease

On the *Preserve / Increase* card should be written one thing that character
holds as a core value.  It can be noble or vain, physical or conceptual, the
important thing is it makes them who they are

Ditto, but opposite for the *Oppose / Decrease* card.

When the character acts in a way that embodies this characteristic, the
Storyteller can instruct them to move a green token from the *Motivator*
card to their character sheet.

See also Dungeon World Flags
http://rpg.divnull.com/wiki/index.php/Dungeon_World_Flags
And Hero Points
http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/systemdesign/heropoints.html

Perhaps a system where acting according to fundamental motivators keeps the
cards (and the conscience) clean, but acting against can get some temporary
boon (a green token in the character sheet) at a price (a red token on the
Motivator card).  While there is a red token on the Motivator card, green
tokens cannot move from it to the character sheet.  Also, if there is a red
token on the Motivator card at End of Session, the card won't produce 2 green
tokens as it normally would.

Another player can offer an opportunity to act out your Motivator, in which
case, if your character acts in alignment, they can choose to put one of
their green tokens from their character sheet onto your Motivator, or take
the red token off your Motivator and put it on one of theirs.

```
This should not clobber the *intrinsically fun* kind of roleplaying - but
it should push players to roleplay into zones of discomfort
https://rottenpulp.blogspot.com.br/2014/07/dont-reward-your-players-for-role.html
```

----

Maybe another way to look at this is as *Values*.  Values are the foundational
narratives.  Believing in these narratives creates identity.  Identity is as
precious as life itself.  Sort of like "morals".

eg:

 * I am unfailingly honest
 * Families should be close
 * Some were born to serve, some to rule
 * Everything is a negotiation
 * Someone will clean up after me
 * If you make mistakes, you don't deserve love
 * Caveat Emptor


### Let's take a look at Flags

`Compassionate: offer me an easier solution that requires I exploit those weaker than me`

What if the GM offered a green token *now* for them to exploit, and the
price was a red token goes on the Motivator card as well.

Conversely another player can offer a similar opportunity:

```
Mage: Bah! My familiar is injured.  Well, maybe it's blood will be of some
use in a potion... [Motions to sacrifice it]
Ranger: No, it's just a cute little doggo!
Mage: I can't keep caring for it if it is useless to me.
Ranger: I'll take care of it for you, until it's leg mends.
```

Then the Mage, invoking the Ranger's Flag, could take the red token on their
flag, or could put a green token from their (the Mage's) character sheet
onto the Ranger's character sheet

# Maybe? 3rd Act Threshold

If your character takes the Gift of The Goddess and crosses the threshold
into the third act, they can **Change**.  Choose one of your Motivator cards
(probably the one with the most red tokens) and discard it and all tokens on
it.  The GM will present you with 4 other Motivator cards.  Choose one and
keep it.

# Deckahedron Module: Red Turns

If a player takes an inordinate amount of time with their turn, or if they
talk over another player that was trying to take a turn, they are given
a red token.  The Storyteller can put the red token on any of the player's
cards.  Any green tokens on a card may not be used until all the red tokens
on that card have been used first.

## Using a red token

`TODO`

# Examples


 * I will not be like my parent
 * I must be like my parent

 * I must redeem a mistake I made
  * Provide an opportunity but make the same style of mistake
  * Sacrifice to one of the victims of the mistake
  * Accept that the consequences of the mistake were more dire than assumed
  * Miss a chance at absolute redemption

 * I am not worthy of my gift

 * I will be tested and found wanting / I'm not ready yet


# Deckahedron Module: Good Bank / Bad Bank

## Good Bank

Add a point when:

 * start out in a place of comfort
  - this can be a fight
 * meet a mentor
 * cross a threshold
 * fun & games
 * encroaching death
 * gift from goddess
 * cross 2nd threshold
 * victory over internal & external death
 * return home

Spend points for:
 * Ressurect a character / prevent a death
 * Deus Ex Machina: redo a flip with maximum advantage
 * Deus Ex Machina: bring in a friendly (already seen) NPC at a moment of extreme peril

# Risk Drivers

Give each player a Risk Driver card, write on it the aspect of the
character's personality that makes them take risks

 * curiosity
 * vengance
 * justice
 * grief
 * supporting a vice
 * other

Start the adventure with 2 green tokens on that card.

When another player triggers the Risk Driver, and the character acts in
accordance with it, a green token moves from the card to the character
sheet.

When the GM triggers the Risk Driver, and the character acts in
accordance with it, a new green token goes on the card.

The GM can make the narrative decision really tough.

When the GM triggers the Risk Driver, and the character refuses to take
a risk, the GM can put a red token on the card.  Now they can't get the
green tokens until they first "burn off" the red tokens.

When there are 3 red tokens on the card, the character can "cross a
threshold" and their personality can change.  They take a new Risk Driver
card and it starts with 0 red tokens and 2 green and they can also
discard a Move card for a "fresh" (base level) Move card.

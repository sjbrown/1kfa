# Deckahedron Module: Flashbacks

After a player makes a flip, and before the GM describes the consequence of
the flip, the player can declare they're going to `do a flashback`.

The player spends 2 green tokens from their character sheet.  Then they
describe how something that happened in the past particularly prepared them
for this situation.

Then they can ignore the original flip, and flip again, with one level of
advantage.  (eg, if they were doing a flip-three-take-worst flip, now they
do a flip-two-take-worst)

After they tell their flashback, the GM may allow them to spend additional
green tokens for more advantage levels.  This is a subjective judgement left
up to the GM.

## Mercy Flashbacks

Players may find themselves in a situation where they forgot to do something
when they had the chance, like use healing magic while they were resting,
or leveling up a skill when they were in the steading, or getting some key
information from an NPC before that NPC died.

As long as the player and the GM both agree that the player had the necessary
resources when the action was available, the GM may allow the player to
spend those resources and effect that action now, as a "Mercy Flashback",
for the additional cost of a green token.

Forgetting happens to the best of us, and there are lots of variables to keep
track of, so the cost is kept "cheap" at only one green token.  But a
cost is nessecary to keep the flow of the game going.  This is a game of
improv storytelling, and improv means rolling with the punches sometimes.

## Preparedness

If you are using the Speed / Equimpent / Money module, you can also play
flashbacks this way:

The player may instead spend one green token and one `Equipment` token and
then describe a piece of equipment they brought with them and how it will
help out in this situation.

This will similarly allow them to ignore the original flip and flip again
with one level of advantage.

Similarly, the GM may allow the player to spend additional `green tokens`
for extra advantage, depending on the equipment and description given by
the player.

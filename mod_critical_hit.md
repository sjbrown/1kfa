# Green tokens for Advantage

After a flip, a player may choose to spend **2** green tokens to
ignore the results of that flip and flip again, this time taking
+1 advantage.

# Critical flips / Exploding flips

When a player flips and gets the green ring card

(it must be the card that is used for the result of the action)

Then they may spend **only one** green token from their
character sheet to *immediately* make an *additional* move with
a +1 advantage
